## Challenge 1: Churn Detection  
**Solution:** `churn-detection` by Asma  
**Type:** Binary Classification  
**Evaluation Metric:** `F1 Score`

### Problem Statement:
The goal was to predict whether a customer is likely to **churn or not**, based on various features provided in a tabular dataset.

### Approach:
- **Data Exploration:** 
  - Handled missing values, categorical encoding, and distribution analysis.
  - Visualized correlations between features and churn label.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Normalization/standardization where needed.
  - Split into training/validation/test sets.
- **Modeling:**
  - Tried multiple classification models: (e.g. Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression)
  - Used `GridSearchCV` or cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Evaluation:**
  - Final model evaluated using **F1 Score**, to handle imbalanced classes.
- **Results:**
  - Achieved a score of **[insert score here]** on the test set.

### Notes:
- [ ] Insert exact model name and best hyperparameters.
- [ ] Add insights about features or feature importance.

## Challenge 2: Football Players Detection  
**Solution:** `football-players-detection` by Asma  
**Type:** Object Detection  
**Evaluation Metric:** `mean Average Precision (mAP)`

### Problem Statement:
Develop an object detection model to identify and localize all players within a football field from static images.

### Approach:
- **Dataset Handling:**
  - Used bounding box annotations provided.
  - Split dataset for training/validation.
- **Modeling:**
  - Used a YOLO-based or SSD-based deep learning model.
  - Trained the model with bounding boxes and image augmentation techniques.
- **Submission Format:**
  - Predictions returned as: `filename,xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax,confidence,label`
- **Evaluation:**
  - Submissions scored using **mean Average Precision (mAP)** for object detection accuracy.

### Notes:
- [ ] Add mAP score you obtained.
- [ ] Mention architecture (e.g. YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN).
- [ ] Challenges: Small objects? Occlusion? Background noise?

## Challenge 3: Arabic Manuscripts Digitization  
**Solution:** `chicas2` by Malak  
**Type:** Handwriting Transcription (OCR)  
**Evaluation Metric:** `Character Error Rate (CER)`

### Problem Statement:
Automatically transcribe Arabic handwritten manuscripts, particularly in the **Maghribi** style, into machine-readable text.

### pproach:
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Normalized image sizes, binarization, and noise removal.
  - Cropped/padded inputs for consistency.
- **Modeling:**
  - Built a **CRNN (CNN + BiLSTM + CTC)** architecture.
  - Defined custom Arabic vocabulary to improve accuracy.
- **Training:**
  - Trained on labeled dataset with image-text pairs.
- **Evaluation:**
  - Measured **Character Error Rate (CER)** on test set.
  - Lower CER = better performance.

### Notes:
- [ ] Insert architecture details (e.g., VGG + BiLSTM).
- [ ] Mention final CER score.
- [ ] Add samples of predicted vs ground truth text.
